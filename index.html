            Eren Yeager was a former member of the Survey Corps. He was the main
            protagonist of Attack on Titan. He lived in Shiganshina District
            with his parents until the fall of Wall Maria, where he impotently
            witnessed his mother being eaten by a Titan. This event would lead
            to Eren's intense hatred towards the Titans as he swore to wipe all
            of them off the face of the Earth to protect his friends - Mikasa
            and Armin.
